# Smol Hatchling: Outer Wilds Scale Manipulator

Smol Hatchling is a scale manipulation tool that allows other mods to easily change the size of any object in Outer Wilds!

Smol Hatchling will automatically make adjustments to the behavior of resized objects to make sure they don't malfunction and that their features match the different sizes.

## Features

### Resize the Player Character

Smol Hatchling allows other mods to seamlessly resize the player character! The speed and damage resistence of the player, position of attachment points such as the ship's pilot seat, and more will be automatically adjusted to accomodate the character's size.

The player's size can also be set to a custom value by the user in the config menu.

### Resize Anything

Technically, any object in Outer Wilds can be resized using Smol Hatchling. While some things may not behave exactly as expected when changed to a different size, I can always add support for more objects in the future. If you notice anything that doesn't quite work right when resized, open an issue and I'll look into it!
